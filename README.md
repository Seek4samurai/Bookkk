<h1>Bookkk - anonymous, open source and easy Opinionator</h1>
<p>This is a completely anonymous, open source and easy opinionator. You can write down anything on Bookkk and other people can read them and either upvote or downvote them. Consider this as a public diary where others can read your thoughts but won't know who wrote it. Thanks to Appwrite's easy database management.</p>

<h2>Why made this?</h2>
<p>This is where you can write down whatever you want to write and it's completely anonymous. So you don't have to make alternate accounts to hide your identity and write something. Consider this as a place like social diary.</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>

The backend database is done using appwrite.

The application's authentication is also handled with Appwrite, user's session is also created by appwrite's `.createSession()`.
When a new user signup occurs, details are stored on the database.
